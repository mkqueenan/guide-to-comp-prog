## 1.1 What is Comp Prog?

Comp prog is the combination of two topics:
1. the design of algorithms
2. the implementation of algorithms

The **design of algorithms** requires problem-solving and mathematical skills. The core of comp is about inventing efficient algorithms that solve well-defined computational problems.

The **implementation of algorithms** requires good programming skills. Within comp prog, the invented solution to a problem is evaluated by testing the implementation using a set of predefined test cases.

Thus, we must come up with an algorithm that solves the problem and then implement our solution.

## 1.1 Tips for Practicing

When getting into comp prog, one should bear in mind that the number of problems solved is not nearly as important as the quality of the problems. The way to really improve one's skills is to focus on problems that appear to be difficult and tedious. Another key observation is that most problems can be solved using simple/short algorithms. The difficulty lies in _inventing_ the algorithm itself. We do not need to learn/memorize complex and obscure algorithms, but rather learn about various problem-solving methods/approaches using simple tools. In the beginning, it can be perceived as boring to implement algorithms in contrast with designing them. However, with practice, we will be able to quickly and correctly implement algorithms which is an important asset.
